Introduction
Welcome to "A Whale off the Port(folio)" project! Delve into this captivating endeavor as we utilize the prowess of Python and Pandas to meticulously dissect various investment portfolios. Our objective is to unearth insights by meticulously comparing the performance and risk metrics of these portfolios.

Files
In this project, we wield three significant files as our arsenal:

1. whale_returns.csv: Unveils the returns attributed to renowned "whale" investors' portfolios.
2. algo_returns.csv: Unveils the returns stemming from in-house trading algorithms originating from Harold's company.
3. sp500_history.csv: Chronicles historical closing prices of the esteemed S&P 500 Index.

Data Grooming
Our first step involves the extraction of data from CSV files, which then finds its sanctuary within Pandas DataFrames. This is accompanied by a meticulous cleaning procedure, during which null values are promptly excised from our datasets.

Quantitative Exploration
A rich panorama of performance and risk metrics awaits us as we traverse through the heart of this analysis. Our journey unfurls with the computation and visualization of various key aspects for each portfolio. This includes daily returns, cumulative returns, box plots, rolling statistics, correlation analyses, and the unveiling of the revered Sharpe ratios.

Portflio
Our exploration wouldn't be complete without a customized touch. Brace yourself for the assembly of a distinctive portfolio, an entity that shall gallantly stride to compete with its counterparts. Through rigorous evaluation, we shall measure its performance and risk metrics against the backdrop of the others.

Dependencies
In this voyage of analysis, we harness the strength of the following technologies:

- Python: Our trusted companion throughout this journey.
- Pandas: The guiding light for data manipulation and exploration.
- Jupyter Notebook: Our vessel of choice, facilitating a seamless narrative.
